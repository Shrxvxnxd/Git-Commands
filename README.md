# üöÄ Git & GitHub: A Beginner's Cheatsheet

Welcome\! This guide provides a clear and concise overview of the most essential Git commands. Whether you're setting up your first repository or contributing to an open-source project, these commands will form the foundation of your workflow.

-----

## üîß One-Time Initial Setup

First things first, let's tell Git who you are. You only need to do this once on any new machine.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` | Sets the name that will be attached to your commits. |
| `git config --global user.email "you@email.com"` | Sets the email that will be attached to your commits. |
| `git config --list` | Reviews your current configuration settings. |

## üå± Starting a New Project

You can either start a new project from scratch or work on an existing one.

  * **Initialize a new local repository:**

    ```bash
    # Run this inside your project folder
    git init
    ```

  * **Clone an existing repository from a URL:**

    ```bash
    # This creates a local copy of a remote project
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

## üíæ The Daily Workflow

These are the commands you'll use most frequently. This is the core cycle of making changes in Git.

1.  **Check the status** of your files.
    ```bash
    # See which files are new, modified, or staged
    git status
    ```
2.  **Stage your changes** to be included in the next commit.
    ```bash
    # Stage a specific file
    git add <file-name>

    # Stage all changes in the current directory
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Commit your staged changes** with a descriptive message.
    ```bash
    # This saves a snapshot of your staged changes
    git commit -m "A clear message about what you changed"
    ```

## üåø Branching & Merging

Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git branch` | Lists all branches in your repository. |
| `git branch <branch-name>` | Creates a new branch. |
| `git checkout <branch-name>` | Switches to an existing branch. |
| `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` | Creates a new branch and switches to it immediately. |
| `git merge <branch-name>` | Combines the history of the specified branch into the current one. |
| `git branch -d <branch-name>` | Deletes a local branch (use `-D` to force delete). |

<br>

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Working with Remote Repositories

To collaborate with others, you need to sync your local changes with a remote repository (like one on GitHub).

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git remote -v` | Lists all your configured remote repositories. |
| `git remote add <name> <url>` | Adds a new remote repository (e.g., `origin`). |
| `git fetch <remote-name>` | Fetches all the branches from the remote, but doesn't merge. |
| `git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>` | Fetches changes from a remote branch and merges them into your current branch. |
| `git push <remote-name> <branch-name>` | Pushes your committed changes to a remote branch. |

<br>

## ‚è™ Undoing Mistakes

Made a mistake? No problem. Git has powerful tools to help you go back.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git checkout -- <file>` | **Discards changes** in a file, reverting it to the last commit. |
| `git reset <file>` | **Un-stages** a file, but keeps your changes in the working directory. |
| `git reset --soft HEAD~1` | **Undoes the last commit** but keeps all changes staged. |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | **DANGER:** **Undoes the last commit and permanently deletes** all changes. |
| `git stash` | Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can switch branches. |
| `git stash pop` | Applies the most recently stashed changes and removes them from the stash list. |

<br>

-----

## üìú Inspecting History

Review past commits to understand the history of your project.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git log` | Shows the detailed commit history. |
| `git log --oneline` | Shows a condensed, one-line view of the commit history. |
| `git show <commit-hash>` | Shows the metadata and changes for a specific commit. |

## ü§ù The Fork & Pull Request Workflow

This is the standard way to contribute to open-source projects.

1.  **Fork the Repository**

      * On the GitHub project page, click the "Fork" button. This creates a personal copy of the project under your account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**

      * Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
        ```bash
        git clone <your-forked-repository-url>
        ```

3.  **Add the 'Upstream' Remote**

      * Add the original project repository as a remote. This allows you to pull in changes from the original project to keep your fork updated.
        ```bash
        git remote add upstream <original-repository-url>
        ```
      * You can verify it's set up correctly with `git remote -v`. You should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (the original project).

4.  **Stay Updated**

      * Before you start making changes, fetch and merge the latest updates from the upstream project.
        ```bash
        git fetch upstream
        git merge upstream/main   # Or whatever the primary branch is called
        ```

5.  **Create a Branch, Make Changes, and Commit**

      * Create a new branch for your feature or fix, make your code changes, and commit them.

6.  **Push to Your Fork**

      * Push your new branch to your forked repository (`origin`).
        ```bash
        git push origin <your-branch-name>
        ```

7.  **Create a Pull Request**

      * Go to your forked repository on GitHub. You'll see a prompt to create a **Pull Request (PR)** from your new branch. Write a clear title and description of your changes, and submit it\!
